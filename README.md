### Step 3: Add screenshot or video

#### Adding a screenshot
Upload a `.png` or `.jpg` of your app to the folder `assets/screenshot/`. The name does not matter. Be sure to delete the placeholder `yourscreenshot.png`.

#### Adding video
Upload your video to the folder `assets/videos/`. To have support for most browsers, you need to upload two files – one for Safari and one for Chrome/Firefox.

Video formats supported by Chrome and Firefox:
- `.webm`
- `.ogg`

Video formats supported by Safari:
- `.mp4`
- `.mov`

#### Resolutions
The videos and screenshots must have one of the following resolutions:
- 828x1792
- 1125x2436
- 1242x2688
